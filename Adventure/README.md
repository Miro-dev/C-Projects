This is made with a Scot Lilly tutorial project:

https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/

The Launch.exe is in .\Adventure\bin\Release

It's a simple RPG game, where you:
 - walk from location to location
 - fight enemies
 - have inventory
 - collect items, quests and rewards
 
Many of the OOP concepts I learned from here.
