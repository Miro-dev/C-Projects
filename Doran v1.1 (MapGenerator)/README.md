This is a Tile Path Generator.
My first independent project.

It is intended to show only the Generator. The other labels and buttons were for testing purposes. The projects is not finished.

To start it you need to to click the green MapGenerator button and wait about 2 minutes for the whole map to be generated.

The algorithm creates two types of tiles- ForbiddenPlace (black squre) and Place (red square). It checks randomly the four directions to
see if a tile exists. When there is no more free space a random Place is chosen and 
the procedure repeats.

The field size and starting point, tile size and iteration number can be changed inside the code.

It needs lots of correction and a revision as a whole.

The .exe file is in bin/Release/

Some maps can be seen in this folder.
